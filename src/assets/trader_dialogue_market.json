    "transcript": "今天早盘大盘出现了跳空低开的走势, 市场情绪明显偏空. 是的, 特别是科技股领跌, 整体板块承压比较大. 我注意到北向资金一开盘就持续流出, 对信心打击不小. 确实, 而且美债收益率的攀升也加剧了风险偏好下降. 从技术面来看, 指数跌破了20日均线, 有进一步下探的可能. 我们是不是该考虑减仓一些高波动性资产, 防止风险扩大？我已经把新能源板块的仓位降低了三成, 规避回撤风险. 不错, 我还在观察黄金走势, 如果站稳1900美元, 可以考虑配置. 对, 但目前美元指数太强, 贵金属短期仍有压力. 你怎么看接下来的美联储利率决议？市场预期是否已经计价？市场大多预期维持利率不变, 但仍要警惕鹰派言论. 昨晚鲍威尔的讲话我听了, 措辞中性偏鸽, 没有太多新意. 不过CPI数据公布之前还是不敢轻举妄动, 波动率可能放大. 我准备把部分流动资金调去做短期国债, 锁定收益. 可以, 防御性策略在当前环境下更合适, 控制回撤才是王道. 听说有几家基金开始清仓部分重仓股, 情绪可能进一步恶化. 是的, 情绪面的影响短期往往放大价格波动, 要控制好杠杆. 我最近还在观察房地产板块的企稳信号, 是否可以博反弹. 要小心基本面支撑不强的反弹, 很容易被套. 另外有传言说证监会准备出手稳定市场, 可信度你怎么看？这种时候任何政策预期都会引发反弹, 但持续性存疑. 操作上我倾向于多看少动, 等市场趋势明朗再进场. 今天的成交量明显放大, 说明抛压还是很重. 我注意到ETF资金流入开始转负, 短期恐难企稳. 没错, 尤其是创业板领跌, 风险偏好快速转弱. 这波下跌如果不能止住, 年线支撑恐怕也要被破. 不过长期来看, 优质资产还是值得分批布局的. 我在考虑做一些量化对冲, 把净值波动控制住. 现在确实是考验风险控制能力的时候. 是的, 仓位管理和资金效率比盈利更重要. 我们保持沟通, 随时根据市场调整策略.

    "translation": "The market opened lower this morning, showing strong bearish sentiment. Yes, especially with tech stocks leading the decline, the overall sector is under pressure. I noticed that northbound funds kept flowing out at the open, hitting investor confidence. Indeed, and the rise in US bond yields further reduced risk appetite. Technically, the index broke below the 20-day moving average, indicating further downside. Should we consider reducing our positions in volatile assets to prevent risk escalation? I've already cut my holdings in the new energy sector by 30% to avoid drawdowns. Good move. I'm also watching gold — if it holds above $1,900, it might be worth allocating. Right, but the strong dollar still weighs on precious metals in the short term. What's your view on the upcoming Fed rate decision? Has the market already priced it in? Most expect rates to stay unchanged, but we should watch out for hawkish comments. I listened to Powell’s speech last night — it was neutral with a slight dovish tilt. Still, we shouldn't act rashly before the CPI release — volatility could spike. I'm planning to allocate some liquidity to short-term bonds to lock in yield. That makes sense. A defensive strategy suits this environment — controlling drawdowns is key. I've heard some funds are unloading heavy positions, which might worsen sentiment. Yes, sentiment-driven moves can amplify price swings — we must manage leverage. I’m also watching for a bottom in real estate stocks to see if a rebound is possible. Be careful with technical rebounds lacking fundamentals — it's easy to get trapped. There are rumors the CSRC may intervene to stabilize the market. What’s your take? Any policy expectation now could spark a rebound, but sustainability is questionable. My approach is to stay observant and wait for a clear trend before re-entering. Volume has surged today, indicating strong selling pressure. ETF inflows have turned negative — stabilization might be difficult short term. Exactly, especially with the ChiNext board falling sharply — risk appetite has faded fast. If this decline doesn't stop, even the yearly moving average might not hold. But in the long run, quality assets are still worth accumulating gradually. I’m considering some quant hedging strategies to keep NAV volatility in check. This is definitely a time to test our risk control discipline. Yes, position sizing and capital efficiency matter more than profits now. Let’s keep in touch and adjust our strategies as the market evolves.",
